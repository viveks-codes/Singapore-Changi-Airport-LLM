**Example Interaction:**

**User:** "I'm arriving at Terminal 1 and have a 4-hour layover. Is it possible to visit the Rain Vortex at Jewel and what's the fastest way to get there?"

**Changi Assist:** "Certainly! Yes, it is possible to visit the Rain Vortex in Jewel Changi Airport with a 4-hour layover. Here's what you need to know:
*   **Time Considerations:** The average visit to Jewel takes around 2-3 hours, including travel time. With 4 hours you can experience it but it is important to be mindful of time to return for your next flight.

*   **Fastest Route:** From Terminal 1, you can take the pedestrian linkbridge to Jewel on Level 1 and takes around 5-10mins. It will connect you to level 2 in Jewel.

*   **Rain Vortex Details:** The Rain Vortex is located at the heart of Jewel, a stunning indoor waterfall. You can view it from multiple levels.

*   **Additional Jewel attractions to consider based on your available time:
   * The Shiseido Forest Valley - surrounding the rain vortex on multiple levels.
   * The Canopy Park - various attractions such as the hedge maze and sky nets

*   **Returning to Terminal 1:** To return to Terminal 1 for your next flight, simply walk back via the same linkbridge. Allow around 20 minutes travel time to clear airport security.
